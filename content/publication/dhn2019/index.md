abstract: "A  framework  for  interactive  visualization  of  script  characteristics,  as  present  in  the  form  of  handwritten  letters,  is  proposed  in this  work.  The  basic  idea  behind  this  investigation  is  to  lay  the  foundations  for  creating  a  comprehensive  atlas  over  letter  forms  extracted from a large collection of handwritten documents, with minimal human guidance. The visualization of the results is based on the atlas metaphor and uses the t-SNE visualization method for creating island-like clusters that can be investigated using the proposed visualization framework. By changing a scale parameter one can investigate the dataset on different levels, i.e different sizes of the clusters."
