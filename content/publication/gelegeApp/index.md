abstract: "This paper presents the “GelegeApp”[^ga], a software system that supports conservationists in surveying and protecting the clutches of waders. The system was developed based on a cooperation between Masters students of the University of Applied Sciences Bremen and the German Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation (BUND) Bremen and has been in use since spring 2016.



### Background

The paper is based on the work that has been performed for the master project course, over the course of one year (24 ECTS). In a group of five students a software system has been developed in order to support the local group of the _German Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation_ (BUND) with the monitoring and conservation of waders (wading birds) and their clutches.

In addition to the accepted paper, a short talk (ca 20 minutes) was given at the accompanying workshop.  


**This paper is only available in German but further details can be provided in English upon request**  


[^ga]: Name of the developed application; can be translated as ClutchApp
